### 📝 Description  
**Hero.io** is a React-based mini project that showcases various applications — including their name, rating, downloads, reviews, and detailed descriptions — in an interface similar to an app store.  
All the data is fetched from a local JSON file, and each app is displayed in a beautifully designed card layout.  
Users can also visit an individual app’s details page, where ratings are visualized through an interactive chart.
